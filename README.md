# SageMakerStudioLab-starter

This project is to help you understand how to use the free AWS Service Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab.

It contains some Jupyter Notebooks that walk you through some features of this service, and how they compare with Amazon SageMaker itself.

Note that "Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab" is intended to be used as a standalone free service for building Machine Learning models. 
It is a free stand-alone AWS Service, that does not require an AWS Account. 
By default, notebooks in the Lab are not able to connect to any AWS Service (unless you provide a suitable key/secret key combination).

So many of the existing SageMaker Jupyter notebooks will not work in the 'Lab'. 
To help this transition, I have put together some of the common notebooks I used in SageMaker, and re-factored them to work in 'Lab.
