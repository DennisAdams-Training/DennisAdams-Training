# How to run 'Dive into Deep Learning' course in Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab

To run the D2L course, you need to upload these files into your Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab 'Project" (aka Jupyter Lab):

- d2l-env.yml
- Setup.ipynb

## Instructions 

Right click on the `d2l-env.yml` file and choose 'Build Conda Environment'. This will start a Terminal Session and run Conda commands to install the necessary libraries for running D2L.

Double-click on the `Setup.ipynb` file to open it, and run through all the cells. This will download and unpack the ZIP file containing all the 'Dive into Deep Learning' artifacts.
